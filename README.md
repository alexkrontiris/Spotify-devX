Project "Instamusic" for Spotify devX 2017

# Instamusic
A fun project using the Spotify developer API as part of the devX Hackathon. "Instamusic" features audio hashtags, spreading out hapiness through music!

## Usage
Visit [Instamusic's](https://workable-flute.glitch.me/) homepage and click on "LOG IN WITH SPOTIFY" to upload a picture accompanied with a hashtag. All you have to do is include the prefix "#spotifybot-" followed by a song, artist or even just  any word you might have in mind and observe what happens!
